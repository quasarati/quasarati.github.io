        <p>I would like to welcome delegation to the node I am operating:</p>

        <p>NodeID-DhNYzUwYHPF24Wfz9MmmVyqLBUF6tkEpb (nick named RockSolid)

        <p>I strive for a high uptime, but will apply updates on the OS and validator software even at the cost of some
            uptime, but so far this has been possible without dropping below 100% on avascan.</p>

        <p>I chose to validate for a year which says something about my commitment to keep it running. Of course
            delegators may select their own validation period from 2 weeks to the maximum of the time left until the
            main validation ends. Feel free to try it out with a short period to test the waters.</p>

        <p>The protocol wil handle payout and the delegation fee so there is no need to trust the node for that. The
            only requirement to earn the reward is that the node has a higher percentage than 60% as perceived by other
            nodes on the network. Itâ€™s all or nothing, so if the perceived uptime is well above 60% full rewards will be
            given.</p>

        <p>The delegation fee is currently 2%.</p>

        <p>I have Grafana node monitoring software installed.
            I also have active monitoring which will alert me instantly in case of problems</p>

        <p>Currently running in the Azure Cloud. I also have infrastructure ready to go on the Hetzner platform and the
            ability to quickly switch over which is part of the disaster recovery strategy.</p>

        <p>The node is secured with a firewall. Only ssh and the staking port are exposed to the internet. OS Security
            updates are applied regularly. The validator software is always updated to the latest version unless there
            is a problem with that version.
